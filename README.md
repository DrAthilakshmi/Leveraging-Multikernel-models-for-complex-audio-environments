The Cocktail Party Problem (CPP), a classic challenge in signal processing, involves separating mixed audio signals from multiple sources into their original components.This research presents a novel approach to CPP resolution by 
leveraging Independent Component Analysis (ICA) combined with Radial Basis Function Sampler (RBF Sampler) preprocessing. The proposed methodology involves mapping the mixed signal features into a higher-dimensional space using the 
RBF Sampler kernel function.
